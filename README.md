DB19 3D printed Male &amp; Female version

From Amazon you can purcase these pins. I know the male pins work but I have not tested the female pins in the femail 3D printed connector.

The best I have found is to order these items with the choices of: 3D Technology of SLA resign, material of black resin, color of grayish black, sanding of yes. I order from JLCPCB and they are about $1.00 each for the male version.

Like said above, I have not ordered, used or pinned the female version yet. 

USE THE FEMALE VERSION AT YOUR OWN RISK
