DB19 3D printed Male &amp; Female version

From Amazon you can purcase these pins. I know the male pins work but I have not tested the female pins in the female 3D printed connector.

Recently purchased 400 pins from this link in the US and they work great.

Another source for the male only pins this unit was specifically designed to use is:

This is from Europe and I can't seem to order from the site and have them shipped to Florida. Joakim orders them and sends to me.

The best I have found is to order these items with the choices of: 3D Technology - SLA resign, material - black resin, color - grayish black, sanding - yes from JLCPCB and they are about $1.00 each for the male version.

USE THE FEMALE VERSION AT YOUR OWN RISK AS THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS
