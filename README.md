# DB19

DB19 3D printed Male &amp; Female version

From Amazon you can purcase these pins. I know the male pins work but I have not tested the female pins in the female 3D printed connector.

Another source for the male only pins this unit was specifically designed to use is:

This is from Europe and I can't seem to order from the site and have them shipped to Florida. Joakim orders them and sends to me. Anyone find a similar product that works from the USA, please let us know.

The best I have found is to order these items with the choices of: 3D Technology - SLA resign, material - black resin, color - grayish black, sanding - yes. I order from JLCPCB and they are about $1.00 each for the male version.

Like said above, I have not ordered, used or pinned the female version yet. 

USE THE FEMALE VERSION AT YOUR OWN RISK
